          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element is a container for metadata. The user wont see information in the head or meta elements.</li>
          <li>The meta elements contain information about the page that is used by the browser. The user wont see information in the head or meta elements.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The li element represents a new bullet point in our list.</li>
          <li>The section element are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>

       <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
       <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
       <li>A color can be picked by semantic references such as gray or blue but can also be refered by its hex code (hex #(type code here)</li>
       <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
       <li>If a "class selector" is called ex. ".card" we can use the code inside this class for multiple "section" elements in our Html code.</li>
       <li>Inline CSS: Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a "style" attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
       <li>Internal style sheet: This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
       <li>External CSS style sheet: is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>

       <li>git pull origin main: pulls the source code from github to ensure that we have the latest commits and changes. Terminal should say "already/branch is up to date."</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul> 
        <li>Enter your Javascript notes here</li>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>Comments: /*Everything in between is a comment.*/ or we can use // if the comment is on the same line.</li>
        <li>Boolean: This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks. Example: let myVariable = true;</li>
        <li>Assignmen: As you've seen already: this "=" assigns a value to a variable.</li>
        <li>Strict equality: This '===' performs a test to see if two values are equal. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result.</li>
        <li>What exactly do we mean by “truthy” and “falsy” in Javascript? 
          A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false.
          All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
        <li>An array: is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Example: var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];</li>
        <li>A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on. Example: var studentInfo = ["Lu", 54, true];</li>
        <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1. Example: ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"] = 0, 1, 2, 3...,</li>
        <li>In order to see one of the data in the array we have to type in console.log(shapes[0]); ( we would then see the triangle) 
          (var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];)</li>
        <li>for loop: A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
        <li>Example of a for loop: for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++)</li>
        <li>While writing a for loop. Think of length = the length of the array topics 0,1,2,3.. so the length will be 4.</li>
        <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run.
          Example of function: function selectTopic()</li>
        <li>Function: functions needs to be called (call a function). Example: function listTopics(). To call it you type: 'listTopics()' under the function code.</li>
