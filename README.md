## Description


This is my first project as a bootcamp student and this study guide is created for students to make it easy to get through the Prework for the Bootcamp. This guide contains notes to help you understand HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. During this project I have learned alot about designing a website and writing code in JavaScript.

## Usage

In this study guide each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
